# Machine Vision for Automated Robot Handling
Development of an Algorithm for Controlling a Robotic Arm. Based on images of a metal piece with cutouts of arbitrary shapes and the architecture of a gripper arm, the algorithm should determine the optimal positioning on the metal piece, ensuring no overlap with the cutouts.
